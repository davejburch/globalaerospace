if (press > 1) { additionalMS += ((press-1)*500); }             //same button used, pause between, but not last

I did think about this part and originally had additionalMS add 500 the extra time, without removing one.


if (press > 1) { additionalMS += 500; }                       //if we were including last multi keypress 500 -depends on actual keypad operation
